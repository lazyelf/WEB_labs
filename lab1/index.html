        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf">An elf (plural: elves)</a> is a type of humanoid supernatural being in <u>Germanic mythology and folklore</u>. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem generally to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.

    <h5>Etymology of the word</h5>
    <p>
        The English word elf is from the Old English word most often attested as ælf (whose plural would have been *ælfe). Although this word took a variety of forms in different Old English dialects, these converged on the form elf during the Middle English period.[33] During the Old English period, separate forms were used for female elves (such as ælfen, putatively from Common Germanic *), but during the Middle English period the word elf came routinely to include female beings.</p>
    <p>
        The Old English forms are cognates – linguistic siblings stemming from a common origin – with medieval Germanic terms such as Old Norse alfr ('nightmare, elf'; plural alfar), Old High German alp ('evil spirit'; pl. alpî, elpî; feminine elbe), Burgundian *alfs ('elf'), and Middle Low German alf ('evil spirit'). These words must come from Common Germanic, the ancestor-language of the attested Germanic languages; the Common Germanic forms are reconstructed as *ɑlβi-z and *ɑlβɑ-z.
    </p>
    <p>
        A completely different etymology, making elf a cognate with the Rbhus, semi-divine craftsmen in Indian mythology, was also suggested by Kuhn, in 1855. In this case, *ɑlβi-z connotes the meaning, "skillful, inventive, clever", and is a cognate with the Latin labor, in the sense of "creative work". While often mentioned, this etymology is not widely accepted.
